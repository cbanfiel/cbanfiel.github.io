          <h1>On Paper Sports Series</h1>
          <p>Languages/Frameworks: JavaScript/React Native</p>
          <p>
            On Paper Sports is a GM Game written in React Native, the series has
            received hundereds of downloads on the Google Play Store and Apple
            App Store. This is by far the largest project I have built.
          </p>
          <p>
            The series is 3 separate games simulating different sports. On Paper
            Sports Basketball '20, On Paper Sports Football '20 and On Paper
            Sports Hockey '20
          </p>
          <p>
            The games allow a user to control a team and simulate various
            seasons with that team. It gives you complete control of the team,
            including trading, free agency, off-season, draft and various other
            abilities to build your team. There is also a college mode in which
            a user will have to recruit players to join there team.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game also allows for custom rosters to be loaded in. I love
            making rosters for the game as a hobby and have also written a web
            scraper for the app written in Node.JS that scrapes the web for
            player information and stats and converts that information into
            usable ratings for the game.

          <h1>Make Me A Drink App</h1>
          <p>Languages/Frameworks: JavaScript/React Native</p>
          <p>
            After building out such a logic intensive game as the On Paper
            Sports series I wanted to create something very simplistic. The Make
            Me A Drink app uses an online cocktail database's API for recipes
            and images. The app provides the user with a very simplistic and
            beautiful design
          </p>
          <p>
            A drink is randomly shown to the user on a card, that can be flipped
            over to see the recipe for the said drink. The user can also
            favorite a drink and view a favorites list. When a new drink is
            grabbed the current card slides to the left of the screen and a new
            card slides in from the right

          <h1>COVID-19 Michigan Predictions</h1>
          <p>Languages/Frameworks: Python/Flask and HTML/CSS</p>
          <p>
            This web application was written using Flask which is a web
            framework for python. For a group project in class my group
            collected case and death information daily on COVID-19. This data
            was grabbed via a web scraper and saved to a SQL database. My job
            was to use this data in a meaningful way
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided it would be neat to predict the spread of COVID-19. The
            data was collected county by county so I figured it would be neat to
            predict the growth unique to each county. The application takes in
            this specific data and using simple mathematical formulas comes up
            with a growth curve.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app takes into account the predicted length of the first wave of
            COVID-19 as well as the predicted peak day of new cases. These
            numbers can be changed by a user on the web app.
          </p>
          <p>
            The web app was then built to display these numbers in a meaningful
            way using HTML tables and Chart.JS

          <p>
            For my independent study at Eastern Michigan. I was tasked with
            making a website for a company that wanted to deliver a streaming
            application for there video training series.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did the entire full-stack for the website. Which included setting
            up the database and working with it in PHP. Also setting up and
            using a payment API so that users could buy individual training
            videos.

          <h1>Java College Football Game</h1>
          <p>
            This was my very first project that I worked on. It is what inspired
            the On Paper Sports Series. Using Java and JavaFX as the UI. I built
            out a full college football GM game much like what On Paper Sports
            Football '20 is. This was the first project that really made me
            enjoy coding.
